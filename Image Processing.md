**It is a method that develops to convert the image into digital form and perform some operations 
to obtain specific models or to extract useful information from it

Generally, the Image Processing system treats images as two-dimensional signals 
when applying predetermined signal processing methods.**

# Image processing basically involves the following three steps:
1. Image acquisition with optical scanner or digital photos.
2. Analyze and use images that include non-human staining patterns such as data compression, image enhancement, and satellite photographs.
3. Output, modified based on image analysis of results, ready to use

# Purposes
There are different purposes of image processing:

- Visualization – Observing objects that are difficult to see.
- Image sharpening and restoration – Improving noisy images.
- Image retrieval – Attractive and high-resolution image search.
- Pattern recognition – Defining various objects in an image.
- Image recognition – Detecting objects in an image.
