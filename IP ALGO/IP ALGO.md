Image processing algorithms commonly used for complete image capture can be categorized into:

1. Low-level techniques, such as color enhancement and noise removal

2. Medium-level techniques, such as compression and binarization,

3. Higher-level techniques, such as segmentation, detection, and recognition algorithms extract semantic information from the captured data.

# Types of Image Processing Algorithms

 
**Contrast Enhancement algorithm: Colour enhancement algorithm is further subdivided into**

* Histogram equalization algorithm: Using the histogram to improve image contrast
* Adaptive histogram equalization algorithm: It is the histogram equalization which adapts to local changes in contrast
* Connected-component labeling algorithm: It is about finding and labeling disjoint regions
* Dithering and half-toning algorithm: Dithering and half-toning includes of the following -

**Error diffusion algorithm** 
* Floyd–Steinberg dithering algorithm
* Ordered dithering algorithm
* Riemersma dithering algorithm
* Elser difference-map algorithm: It is a search algorithm used for general constraint satisfaction problems. It was used initially for X-Ray diffraction microscopy.

**Feature detection algorithm: Feature detection consists of**

* Marr–Hildreth algorithm: It is an early edge detection algorithm
* Canny edge detector algorithm: Canny edge detector is used for detecting a wide range of edges in images.
* Generalized Hough transform algorithm
* Hough transform algorithm
* SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) algorithm: SIFT is an algorithm to identify and define local features in images.
* SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) algorithm: SURF is a robust local feature detector.
* Richardson–Lucy deconvolution algorithm: This is an image deblurring algorithm.

* Blind deconvolution algorithm: Much like Richardson–Lucy deconvolution, it is an image de-blurring algorithm when point spread function is unknown.

* Seam carving algorithm: Seam carving algorithm is a content-aware image resizing algorithm

**Segmentation algorithm: This particular algorithm parts a digital image into two or more regions**

* GrowCut algorithm: an interactive segmentation algorithm
* Random walker algorithm
* Region growing algorithm
* Watershed transformation algorithm: A class of algorithms based on the watershed analogy
